### Task 2 â€“ Power BI Dashboard (Netflix Dataset)
##ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship â€“ Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling.
Using the cleaned Netflix dataset from Task 1, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze content growth, genre distribution, ratings, and country-specific contributions.
The goal is to transform raw data into business insights through effective storytelling.

##ðŸ›  Steps Performed

Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI.

Checked and formatted datatypes (date, numeric, categorical).

Created calculated measures using DAX (e.g., content counts, percentages).

Designed interactive visuals to track Netflix content trends.
